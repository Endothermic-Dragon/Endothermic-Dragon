- Languages - HTML, CSS, SASS/SCSS, JavaScript/NodeJS, Python, Java
- NodeJS libraries - Express, Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, Terser, MathJax
- Python libraries - NumPy, Pwntools, Requests, Flask, Pandas, SciPy, Keras, TensorFlow, PyGame, Multiprocessing
- Generally competent - PostgreSQL, C/C++
- Cybersecurity strengths (CTF/hacking skills) listed with strongest on top
  - Code injection & exploitation, user input manipulation, manipulating HTTP requests
    - Often uses languages like Python, Go, C/C++, or Java
  - Cryptography - breaking RSA or an insecure variant, breaking AES, custom encryption schemes, insecure random generation, etc.
    - Often uses languages like Python or JavaScript
    - Requires deep understanding of the math involved
  - Insecure Python and C code exploits, manipulating Linux
  - Steganography (metadata, LSB, obscured data, undisplayed hex data, etc.)
  - Binary exploitation (buffer manipulation, exploiting return address, C exploits, etc.)
